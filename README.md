# Processing-Project
A simple script written in Processing that shows the effect of  Perlin noise in 3D.
#Perlin noise
Perlin noise is a random sequence generator producing a more natural, harmonic succession of numbers than that of the standard random() function. It was developed by Ken Perlin in the 1980s and has been used in graphical applications to generate procedural textures, shapes, terrains, and other seemingly organic forms.
